#How to create a variable and print the value of the variable. Assigning a value to a variable is also called binding. 
iq = 190
print(iq)

#Variable are snake_case, start with lowercase or underscore, letters, numbers, underscores, case sensitive, and cannot overwrite keywords. 

#Example of snake_case
user_iq = 190 
print (iq)

#Example of snake_case with a private varaible
_user_iq = 190
print(_user_iq)

#Example of case sensitive varaiable. 
# user_IQ = 190
# print(user_iq)

#Example of why you cannot overwrite keywords which already are defined 
# print = 190
# print(print)

#A variable should be a good descriptor or indicator of what the variable is used/stored for in their code. 

#Example of how to store and use variables and Arithmetic operators. 
iq = 190 
user_age = iq / 4
a = user_age
print(a)

#Constants is a type of variable which doesn't change or meant to change. 
PI = 3.14 
print(a)

#Dunder is another type of variable and should be left alone. A user knows if something is a "dunder" variable when there are two underscores. 
# __

#Example of assigning multiple variables to a value. 
a,b,c = 1,2,3 
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#Expression & Statements. 

#Example of expression is a piece of code which produces a value (e.g. iq/5) is the expression. 
iq = 100 
user_age = iq / 5
print (user_age)

# Example of a statement. A statement is an entire line of code (e.g. user_age = iq / 5) & (iq = 100) is the statement.
iq = 100 
user_age = iq / 5
print(user_age)

#Augemented assignment operator. 
some_value = 5

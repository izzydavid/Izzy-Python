#Augemented assignment operator.

#Example of how we can use a assignment operator to redefine the value of a variable (e.g. some_value = +=2). This will take the declared variable and add 2. If you don't declare the variable first then you cannot conduct an augemented assignment operator.
some_value = 5
some_value += 2
some_value -= 2
some_value *= 2
some_value = some_value * 2
print(some_value)
